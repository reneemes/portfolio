        <p>
          My career journey began with a passion for problem-solving, which has driven me to excel in diverse roles—whether I’m ensuring smooth operations as a flight attendant, piloting unmanned systems, or managing teams in high-pressure environments.
          With a background in unmanned vehicle system operations, I enjoy tackling complex technical challenges and ensuring precision in everything I do. As a communications specialist, I honed my ability to formulate clear and impactful messages, while my experience as a flight attendant has strengthened my leadership and crisis management skills.
          No matter the industry or task, I’m committed to delivering high-quality results, always looking for opportunities to grow and apply my versatile skill set to new challenges.
